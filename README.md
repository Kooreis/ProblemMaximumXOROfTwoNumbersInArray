# Question: How do you find the maximum XOR of two numbers in an array? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `findMaxXOR` is designed to find the maximum XOR (exclusive OR) of two numbers in an array. It starts by initializing two variables, `max` and `mask`, to zero. The function then enters a loop that iterates from 31 down to 0. In each iteration, the `mask` is updated by bitwise OR operation with the result of shifting 1 to the left by `i` places. A new Set `set` is created to store the result of bitwise AND operation of each number in the array with the `mask`. A temporary variable `temp` is then created by performing a bitwise OR operation on `max` and the result of shifting 1 to the left by `i` places. The function then checks if the `set` contains the result of XOR operation of `temp` and each `prefix` in the `set`. If it does, `max` is updated to `temp` and the inner loop breaks. After all iterations, the function returns `max` which is the maximum XOR of two numbers in the array.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution is different from the JavaScript solution in several ways:

1. Class and Static Method: The TypeScript solution is wrapped in a class named `Solution` and the function `maxSubarrayXOR` is a static method of this class. This is a feature of TypeScript (and ES6 JavaScript) that allows for better organization of code, especially for larger codebases.

2. Type Annotations: TypeScript allows for type annotations, which can help catch errors at compile time. In this case, the function `maxSubarrayXOR` has its parameters `set` and `n` annotated with types `number[]` and `number` respectively.

3. Constants: The TypeScript solution uses a constant `INT_SIZE` to represent the size of an integer in bits. This makes the code more readable and maintainable.

4. Different Algorithm: The TypeScript solution uses a different algorithm to solve the problem. It uses the concept of Gaussian elimination in bit manipulation, which is a more complex but potentially more efficient approach. The JavaScript solution, on the other hand, uses a simpler approach of iterating over the bits of the numbers and using a set to keep track of the prefixes.

5. Array Destructuring: The TypeScript solution uses array destructuring (`[set[index], set[maxInd]] = [set[maxInd], set[index]]`) to swap elements in the array. This is a feature available in both TypeScript and modern JavaScript (ES6 and later).

6. Different Test Data: The test data in the TypeScript solution is slightly different from the JavaScript solution, but this doesn't affect the comparison of the solutions themselves.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows the same logic as the JavaScript version. Both versions use a bitwise mask to isolate bits from the most significant to the least significant. They both use a set to store the prefixes of the numbers in the array and then check if the XOR of the temporary maximum and the prefix exists in the set. If it does, the temporary maximum is assigned to the maximum.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax:

1. Input: In JavaScript, the array is hard-coded, while in C++, the user is prompted to enter the number of elements and the elements themselves.

2. Set: In JavaScript, a set is created using the `new Set()` syntax and elements are added using the `add` method. In C++, a set is created using the `set<int>` syntax and elements are added using the `insert` method.

3. Set Lookup: In JavaScript, the `has` method is used to check if an element exists in the set. In C++, the `find` method is used, which returns an iterator to the element if it is found, or `set.end()` if it is not.

4. Looping: In JavaScript, the `for...of` loop is used to iterate over arrays and sets. In C++, the range-based `for` loop is used.

5. Output: In JavaScript, the result is printed to the console using `console.log`. In C++, the result is printed to the console using `cout`.

6. Main Function: In C++, the `main` function is required as the entry point of the program. In JavaScript, there is no such requirement.
